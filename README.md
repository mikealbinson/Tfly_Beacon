# Tfly_Beacon
###An implementation of iBeacon technology to take ticket information, verify that the information exists in a database and display the result

I'll break this down by file. If there are any questions/issues, feel free to drop me a line.

##iBeaconWrite_V2_7.js
The highest up in the file heirarchy of the program. This is where the magic happens. This portion has three main tasks:
1. Performing two shell commands that reset the bluetooth daemon of the Edison
2. Beginning the intialiazation of the rest of the files in the heirarchy
3. Initalizing and managing the iBeacon and BLE services and events of the beacon


##LedsAndBuzzer.js
Pretty simply manages the initialization and manipulation of the LEDs and the buzzer

--One of the more major issues we arrive at here is the lack of ability of the Edison to control its PWM pulses, which results in inconsistent sounds and occasional failure to fully turn off the buzzer, resulting in a high pitched beep that can only be reset by sending a subsequent pulse.

| initUltrasonic()       | Initiate the voltage reading pin to read from the ultrasonic (US).                                                                                                                                                                                                  | N/A       | N/A     | N/A  |
| takeUSReading()        | Calibrates the US on startup. Then takes readings from the US and heavily filters the data to avoid large deviations in US readings.
